        <p>The Making Studio Shop at the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation is a multifaceted and fascinating facility. It provides its users with all the tools, space and advice required to creatively navigate the complexities of a truly unique architectural education. It encourages experimentation and champions flexibility all while safely supporting the hopes and dreams of the imaginative, exhausted but intrepid student of architecture.

        A space as magical as this one no doubt has its obstacles: The shop is unforgivingly confusing to navigate. You basically have to be a seasoned affiliate with a strong sense of intuition in order to keep up with the layout changes, reorganizations and unpredictable behaviors that keep things moving about the space. With this difficulty in mind,<strong>CATALOG: SHOP</strong> will provide the novice user with the most up-to-date introductory level layout of the space. Information such as general locations of power tools, handheld tools, adhesives, sanding or exhaust areas, where to connect your spotify playlist, where to treat an injury and a handful of helpful inside jokes keep your shop experience light-hearted, resourceful and exciting.</p>
